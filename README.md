## Cheetah-Software
This repository contains the Robot and Simulation software project.  For a getting started guide, see the documentation folder.

The common folder contains the common library with dynamics and utilities
The resources folder will contain data files, like CAD of the robot used for the visualization
The robot folder will contain the robot program
The sim folder will contain the simulation program. It is the only program which depends on QT.
The third-party will contain *small* third party libraries that we have modified. This should just be libsoem for Cheetah 3, which Pat modified at one point.

## Build
To build all code:
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
./../scripts/make_types.sh
make -j4
```

If you are building code on your computer that you would like to copy over to the mini cheetah, you must replace the cmake command with
```
cmake -DMINI_CHEETAH_BUILD=TRUE
```
otherwise it will not work.  If you are building mini cheetah code one the mini cheetah computer, you do not need to do this.

This build process builds the common library, robot code, and simulator. If you just change robot code, you can simply run `make -j4` again. If you change LCM types, you'll need to run `cmake ..; make -j4`. This automatically runs `make_types.sh`.

To test the common library, run `common/test-common`. To run the robot code, run `robot/robot`. To run the simulator, run `sim/sim`.

Part of this build process will automatically download the gtest software testing framework and sets it up. After it is done building, it will produce a `libbiomimetics.a` static library and an executable `test-common`.  Run the tests with `common/test-common`. This output should hopefully end with

```
[----------] Global test environment tear-down
[==========] 18 tests from 3 test cases ran. (0 ms total)
[  PASSED  ] 18 tests.
```
## Run Controller
It's worth to note that this project can be implemented on Laptop and UP Board in the robot.
1. Turn on the power supply.
2. Open the saftey switch and you can see 3 bottons on the robots light up.
3. Push the motor botton twice rapidly. After this you can see the actuators starting.
4. Run the controller on the laptop or the UPBoard.
To run the Controller:
1. Open the terminal (Do not use ssh for running the controller!!!!!)
```
cd /IUST_Quadruped_Software/build/user/{Controller_fonlder}
sudo ./{controller_name} i r f
```
i: Iust robot, r: run on robot, f: load parameters from file.
